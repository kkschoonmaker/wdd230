        <h3>Contrast</h3>
        <h4>HP</h4>
        <a href="hp.com">HP.com</a>

        <p>
          Hp.com uses contrast in both color and scale in the design of their
          homepage. The bright green has the highest contrast in color from the
          neutral grey and naturally draws the user’s eye. The leading line of
          the triangle shape leads next to the smaller blue circle and yellow
          square on the right edge of the page. Both of these shapes are also a
          contrasting color from the neutral background. The mustard yellow
          square finally leads your eye to the main section of the page where
          the heading and subheading are at. Also situated in the main section
          is a call to action button, the contrast of the black against a more
          vibrant yellow color helps it to stand out.

        <h3>Alignment</h3>
        <h4>Superlist</h4>
        <a href="superlist.com">Superlist.com</a>

        <img

        />
        <p>
          Superlist.com uses a unique twist on the alignment principle of design
          on their homepage. The menu button is split into two colors right at
          the edge of the word ‘menu.’ Everything straight down from that line
          has the color variation and is affected. The background color turns a
          bright red in that ‘red area’ strip. Text also changes colors on the
          other side of the line, and the scrolling images on the bottom of the
          page have the color affected when they are in the ‘red area.’ This
          emphasizes the words which are split by the line, and it also
          continues to draw the eye down through the entire page.

        <h3>White Space</h3>
        <h4>Square Space</h4>
        <a href="squarespace.com">Squarespace.com</a>
        <br />
        <img
          src="images/screenshot-square-space.jpg"
          alt="Squarespace.com home page screenshot"
        />
        <p>
          Squarespace uses the white space, principle of design on their
          homepage. The white space on the page isn’t actually the color white,
          but it is an area of the page where there are few elements. The
          homepage is simple and clean. It has a logo and a hamburger menu in
          the header, a heading, and a subheading. Other than that, it is one
          image and a CTA button. The lack of elements doesn’t make the page
          boring; it actually has the opposite effect. Because there aren’t many
          elements to distract the viewer it emphasizes the image that they are
          highlighting, and makes it very easy to click the CTA button.
